                        <h4>Not Using the Single-Use Plastics</h4>

                        <p class="main"> Single-Use Plastics such as plastic bags, water bottles, and straws have made human's life convenient and effective throughout our life; 
                            when we go to the cafe,when we go to our famous resturant, and when we go on a picnic, we have been using it, and we might not be hard to 
                            live without it. However, have you ever thought of the effects after we use it once? Usually, those Single-Use plastics are dumped into the 
                            ocean. Those trash devestate the ocean life; ocean life such as turtle cannot recognize the differences between jellyfish and plastic bags,
                            and eating those items are fatal to those ocean lifes. The best way to solve this problem is not to use a Single-Use Plastics. Instead, we
                            can bring our own mug or tumbler to the cafe, buy a reusable container, and not to use a straw.

                        <p class="main"> Recycle is the way that we can deal with the trash problems. By recycling, trash can be used and converted into reusable material, so it regards
                            as a good solution for the ocean trash problem. However, because many people are not willing to do so, the problem became serious, and the ocean
                            life is still suffering. If we do not recycle properly, the trash will be dumped into the ocean since it is treated as a landfill. As a result, 
                            we need to learn how to sort the trash that we produce. <a href="index.php#sort" target="_blank"> Click the link </a> to learn how you can sort the trash properly.
