            <p class = "paragraph"> Hello, and welcome to MY MUSCLE Homepage! We are here to help you with your exercise, 
                especially with <em>the exercise recorder</em>. Recently, the Work-Life balance has been a trend, and one 
                aspect of life can be an exercise! However, many people hesitate over starting any exercise. Why? Let me 
                tell you why. We assume that you have had an experience that you enrolled in a gym. For the first two to 
                three days. You feel enthusiastic; you paid it, and you should exercise to pay-off. However, as you have 
                gone through, you might have had muscle pain, and it does not feel like it is your body. You reduce the 
                gym day per week, and it eventually reaches 0. Don't these feel like your story? Actually, the solution for 
                this is simple: <em>interest</em>. Yes, you should be interested in exercising. At first, it would be hard. However, 
                if you start and try recording your routines, you will find a better you than yesterday. We will invite you 
                to the world of exercise. Try recording through our system!
