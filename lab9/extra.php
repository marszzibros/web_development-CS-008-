        <h3> my information </h3>
        <p> name: Jay Hwasung Jung</p>
        <p> school: Univerty of Vermont</p>
        <p> Today's feeling: I feel sad; in this morning, I just found that my LAB 05's grade was B. If I had not taken it sersiouly, I would not feel sad about it. I spent
            more than four hours to finish it, I do not know what happened at the moment, but I just submitted right away without checking HTML validity check, so I got B+. 
            CS 008 is really hard to study, especially study alone; I am taking an online course, and with lack of materials or instructions, I sometimes do not know what the
            check mark on the lab is. I checked the all the thing that I got wrong on previous LAB. I hope I can get an A+ on this lab, LAB 05. </p>
